  <h3>Rules</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by
      underpopulation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next
      generation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by
      overpopulation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if
      by reproduction.
